<h1>Appendix 1</h1>

<h1>International World Wide Web Consortium ("W3C")</h1>

<h2>1. Organization and Structure.</h2>

<p>The purposes of the Consortium are to support the advancement of
information technology in the field of networking, graphics and user
interfaces by evolving the World Wide Web toward a true information
infrastructure, and to encourage cooperation in the industry through the
promotion and development of standard interfaces in the information
environment known as the "World Wide Web." The roles of MIT, ERCIM and Keio
University (KEIO) are to provide the vendor-neutral architectural,
engineering and administrative leadership required to make this work. The
Consortium began operation October 1, 1994.</p>

<p>The Consortium is financially self-supporting through membership fees.
Membership in the Consortium is open to any operating organization agreeing
to the terms of this Appendix 1 that executes a Consortium Member Agreement.
Initial memberships are for a period of one (1) year beginning on the first
day of the calendar quarter in which the member joins. If the organization is
itself a consortium, user society, or otherwise has members or sponsors, the
rights and privileges granted under this agreement extend only to the paid
employees of the organization, not to the members or sponsors.</p>

<h2>2. Membership.</h2>

<h3>a. Categories.</h3>

<p>Until April 2005, W3C had two categories of Membership: Full and
Affiliate. Both categories had identical privileges. At this time W3C Members
are no longer divided into categories, however the applicable membership fees
depend on the specific circumstances of the Member as described below.</p>

<h3>b. Assignment to Specific Hosts.</h3>

<p>Each Consortium Member is assigned to one Consortium Host based upon the
Member's primary headquarters country. Members in Europe, Africa and the
Middle East are assigned to ERCIM. Members in Japan and Korea are assigned to
KEIO. All other members will be hosted by MIT.</p>

<h3>c. Fees.</h3>

<p>Annual fees for W3C Membership are found on the schedule at <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/fees">http://www.w3.org/Consortium/fees</a>. The fee
applicable to the Member is dependent on circumstances particular to
the Member. Initial memberships are for a period of one (1) year
beginning on the first day of the calendar quarter in which the member
joins. The total fee is due at the time the organization executes a
Member Agreement. The due date in each subsequent year will be the
first day of the calendar quarter during which the member joins; i.e.,
January 1st, April 1st, July 1st or October 1st. MIT's portion of the
Membership Fee may be used by MIT for both direct and indirect costs
of the Consortium, which may include the following: 1) The use of
business class travel in accordance with MIT policy; 2) entertainment
and alcohol expenses; 3) meetings, food, and beverage expenses; and 4)
promotional, memorabilia, and public relations expenses.</p>

<h3>d. Subsidiaries of Members.</h3>

<p>If the organization has subsidiaries, the rights and privileges granted,
and the obligations undertaken under this agreement shall extend to all
subsidiaries the voting stock of which is directly or indirectly at least
fifty percent (50%) owned or controlled by the organization.</p>

<h2>3. Administration.</h2>

<h3>a. Directors.</h3>

<p>The Consortium has an MIT-appointed Director (the "Director"), who acts as
chief architect for all specifications produced by the Consortium. The
present Director is Tim Berners-Lee, who is the original architect of the
World Wide Web protocol and has been directing its development since its
inception at CERN.</p>

<p>The Consortium has an ERCIM-appointed Deputy Director (the "ERCIM Deputy
Director"), who acts as the lead technical person on the ERCIM
staff.</p>

<p>The Consortium has a KEIO-appointed Deputy Director (the "KEIO Deputy
Director"), who acts as the lead technical person on the KEIO staff.</p>

<h3>b. Staff.</h3>

<h4>MIT Staff.</h4>

<p>The MIT Staff of the Consortium will consist of the Director, full-time
engineers, and support personnel. The MIT Staff are in the employ of MIT and
its Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) and
report to the Director. Employment of MIT Staff is solely at the discretion
of MIT.</p>

<h4>ERCIM Staff.</h4>

<p>The ERCIM Staff of the Consortium will consist of the ERCIM Deputy
Director, full-time engineers, and support personnel. The ERCIM Staff are in
the employ of ERCIM and report to the ERCIM Deputy Director. Employment of
ERCIM Staff is solely at the discretion of ERCIM.</p>

<h4>KEIO Staff.</h4>

<p>The KEIO Staff of the Consortium will consist of the KEIO Deputy Director,
full-time engineers, and support personnel. The staff are in the employ of
KEIO and report to the KEIO Deputy Director. Employment of KEIO Staff is
solely at the discretion of KEIO.</p>

<h3>c. Integration within MIT.</h3>

<p>MIT Consortium activities are administered by MIT's Computer Science and
Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL), and the Consortium Director
reports to the Director of CSAIL.</p>

<h3>d. Integration within ERCIM.</h3>

<p>ERCIM Consortium activities are administered within ERCIM, and the ERCIM
Deputy Director reports to the Director of the Consortium on technical and
Consortium administrative matters, and to the Director of Development of
ERCIM on all other administrative matters.</p>

<h3>e. Integration within KEIO.</h3>

<p>KEIO Consortium activities are administered by KEIO, and the KEIO Deputy
Director reports to the Director of the Consortium on technical and
Consortium administrative matters, and to the Dean of KEIO University on all
other administrative matters.</p>

<h3>f. Steering Committee.</h3>

<p>A Steering Committee sets overall policy and provides strategic guidance
and review of the Consortium's activities. The committee members are: the
Director of MIT's CSAIL; an MIT-appointed Chairman of the Consortium; an
MIT-appointed Director of the Consortium; and one representative each from
ERCIM and KEIO. Inasmuch as MIT, ERCIM and KEIO are conducting research on
many aspects of the information infrastructure, a technical committee shall
be established to facilitate the links between MIT, ERCIM, KEIO and other
research worldwide, to the activities of the Consortium. These links will
take place primarily through the technical workshops described in Section
12.</p>

<h2>4. Collaboration.</h2>

<p>MIT, ERCIM and KEIO will collaborate with other organizations in the
development of the Consortium protocols. Aspects of the Consortium reference
implementation may be developed by our collaborators under various
cooperative arrangements.</p>

<h2>5. Visiting Engineers.</h2>

<p>Member organizations may volunteer to contribute staff on short term
assignment to MIT, ERCIM or KEIO for specific implementation efforts
sponsored by the Consortium. If MIT, ERCIM or KEIO has the resources to
accept such staff, the visitors will be provided with unsalaried MIT, ERCIM
or KEIO appointments as Visiting Engineers. For the portion of their time
assigned to Consortium activities, visitors will take their technical
direction from the Director if at MIT, the ERCIM Deputy Director if at ERCIM,
or the KEIO Deputy Director at KEIO.</p>

<h3>6. Advisory Committee.</h3>

<h3>a. Purpose.</h3>

<p>MIT, ERCIM and KEIO shall establish a committee (the "Advisory
Committee"), which shall establish procedures for the Consortium's review
process, review annual plans, assess Consortium progress, and suggest future
directions for the Consortium.</p>

<h3>b. Appointment of Representatives.</h3>

<p>Each member organization is entitled to appoint one individual to the
Advisory Committee.</p>

<h3>c. Meetings.</h3>

<p>The Advisory Committee will meet approximately twice per year. Meetings
for other activities are scheduled as they are needed, and need not take
place at MIT, ERCIM or KEIO.</p>

<h2>7. Standards Review Process and Procedure.</h2>

<p>All proposals for new Consortium standards shall go through the process
detailed in the then-current World Wide Web Consortium Process Document as
approved by the Director (the "Process Document"). The current version of the
Process Document, which may be modified from time to time as approved by the
Advisory Committee and Director, exists at <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process">http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process</a>, which is
hereby incorporated by reference.</p>

<h2>8. Communication within Consortium.</h2>

<p>Consortium activities and communications are performed primarily using the
World Wide Web and electronic mail. Network connectivity to MIT, ERCIM and
KEIO should be viewed as a requirement for adequate participation in
Consortium activities, including the functions of the Advisory Committee.
MIT, ERCIM and KEIO will provide information in tangible form only at the
discretion of the Director.</p>

<h2>9. Software Distribution.</h2>

<p>The Consortium will support a repository of software and related
documentation for such purposes as proof-of-concept, interoperability
testing, and facilitating the work of the Consortium. The contents of this
repository will be determined by the Director based upon the needs and
desires of the Consortium and its member organizations as tempered by
resource constraints. Software will be distributed pursuant to the
then-current W3C Software Notice and License (which exists at <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/copyright-software">http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/copyright-software</a>).
Specific exceptions can be made upon approval of the Director, with the
advice of the Advisory Committee.</p>

<p>For software that is being actively maintained the Consortium will provide
mechanisms by which bug reports can be submitted. The Consortium will provide
mechanisms by which the status and correction of a bug can be obtained.</p>

<p>Member organizations can incorporate software and documentation made
available by the Consortium into products at any time after the materials
have been released to the Consortium. Member organizations shall not adopt or
incorporate such releases into products prior to release to Consortium
Members. Materials are considered released upon distribution to Members by
the Consortium or upon being identified as a Consortium release and being
made accessible over the Consortium network.</p>

<p>Software and documentation made available by the Consortium may include
contributions from Members or non-members ("Contributed Software"), however
the Consortium shall not be responsible for maintaining Contributed Software.
The release of Contributed Software by the Consortium shall be solely at the
discretion of the Director.</p>

<p>Contributed Software will be accepted only if the submitter represents
that it has sufficient right, title and interest to allow the Consortium to
use and distribute the software, however ALL CONTRIBUTED SOFTWARE SHALL BE
PROVIDED "AS IS." THE CONSORTIUM, MIT, ERCIM AND KEIO MAKE NO REPRESENTATIONS
OR WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, WARRANTIES
OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE OR
NON-INFRINGEMENT, NOR THAT IMPLEMENTATION OF SUCH CONTRIBUTED SOFTWARE WILL
NOT INFRINGE ANY THIRD PARTY PATENTS, COPYRIGHTS, TRADEMARKS OR OTHER
RIGHTS.</p>

<p>In general, all materials distributed by the Consortium will be
distributed pursuant to the then-current W3C Software Notice and License (the
current version of which currently exists at <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/copyright-software-19980720">http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/copyright-software-19980720</a>).
Specific exceptions can be made, upon approval of the Director at the advice
of the Advisory Committee.</p>

<h2>10. Use of Hardware.</h2>

<p>The Consortium will not attempt to acquire or maintain hardware platforms
produced by Members, but will attempt to have a reasonable selection of
platforms. All hardware and software acquisitions will be at the discretion
of MIT, ERCIM and KEIO. The Consortium will not be responsible for ensuring
that prototype or released software operates correctly on any particular
hardware or system configuration, but will attempt to ensure portability of
such software to a variety of systems.</p>

<h2>11. Use of Funds.</h2>

<p>The amount of Member fees paid in excess of that amount needed to cover
the direct and indirect costs of the Consortium will be allocated for
innovative Consortium work as determined by the Director at the advice of the
Advisory Committee. However, if the total amount of Member fees paid in any
Consortium Year (October 1 to September 30) exceeds $1.4 million U.S.
Dollars, one-third of the income in excess of $1.4 million U.S. Dollars will
be divided between MIT, ERCIM and KEIO pursuant to separate agreements, to be
used at their discretion.</p>

<h2>12. Technical Conferences.</h2>

<p>The Consortium will sponsor an annual conference, open to the public, to
promote the exchange of technical information about the World Wide Web. Also
workshops will be held in various technical areas such as privacy and
authentication, reliability, computer communication, semantics, and so forth
as deemed necessary and will include experts from MIT, ERCIM and KEIO, and
the international technical community as deemed appropriate by the
Director.</p>
