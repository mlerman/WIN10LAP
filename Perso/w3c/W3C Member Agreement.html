IMPLIED, WITH RESPECT TO ANY SOFTWARE OR DOCUMENTATION PROVIDED OR MADE
AVAILABLE TO THE MEMBER, OR WITH RESPECT TO ANY STANDARD ENDORSED BY MIT,
ERCIM OR KEIO OR THE CONSORTIUM, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY IMPLIED

<h2 id="liability">12. Limitation of Liability.</h2>

<p>In the event of dissolution of the Consortium and termination of this
Agreement by MIT, ERCIM and KEIO pursuant to Section 10 hereof, the Member
shall be entitled to receive, as its sole and exclusive remedy, a refund of
any portion of the Member's duly paid and as-yet uncommitted Member Fee, and
upon such refund, any further liability of MIT, ERCIM and/or KEIO to the
Member shall be extinguished. This remedy is in lieu of all other remedies,
whether oral or written, express or implied. MIT's liability to the Member in

including lost profits, sustained or incurred by the Member in connection
with or as a result of its participation in the Consortium or under this
Agreement.</p>

<h2 id="force-majeure">13. Force Majeure.</h2>

<p>If the performance of any obligation by MIT, ERCIM and KEIO under this
Agreement is prevented, restricted or interfered with by reason of natural
disaster, war, revolution, civil commotion, acts of public enemies, blockade,
embargo, strikes, any law, order, proclamation, regulation, ordinance, demand
or requirement having a legal effect of any government or any judicial
authority or representative of any such government, or any other act or event
which is beyond the reasonable control of the party affected, then MIT, ERCIM
and KEIO shall be excused from such performance to the extent of such

shall use reasonable commercial efforts to avoid or remove such causes of
nonperformance, and shall continue performance hereunder with reasonable
dispatch whenever such causes are removed.</p>

<h2 id="export-controls">14. Export Controls.</h2>

<p>The Member acknowledges that export and/or re-export from the United
States, France, or Japan of technical data, computer software, laboratory
prototypes and other commodities ("Controlled Commodities") may be subject to
the export control laws and regulation of the United States (including the
Arms Export Control Act, as amended, and the Export Administration Act of
1979 revised in 1985), of France, and of Japan, and that such laws and
regulations could preclude or delay export of such Controlled Commodities.
MIT 's, ERCIM's and KEIO's obligation hereunder are contingent on compliance
with such applicable laws and regulations. Neither party will directly or
indirectly export across any national boundary, or communicate or transfer to
any third party, any Controlled Commodities without first obtaining any and
all licenses that may be required from a cognizant agency of the United
States government or the French or Japanese authorities, and/or any and all
written assurances from the Member that it will not re-export or transfer
such Controlled Commodities to certain foreign countries or third parties
without prior approval of the cognizant government agency. While MIT, ERCIM

agency deems necessary in connection with the export, re-export, transfer or
communication of any Controlled Commodities, MIT, ERCIM and KEIO cannot
guarantee that such licenses will be granted.</p>

<p>Neither this Agreement nor any rights hereunder, in whole or in part, are
assignable by the Member without the prior written consent of the Hosts. Any
attempt to assign the rights, duties or obligations under this Agreement by
the Member without such consent shall be a breach of this Agreement and shall
be null and void.</p>

<h2 id="entire-agreement">16. Entire Agreement.</h2>

<p>This Agreement, together with <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Agreement/Appendix.html">Appendix 1</a>, embodies the
entire understanding between MIT, ERCIM, KEIO and the Member for the Member's
participation in the Consortium, and cancels and supersedes any other
agreements, oral or written, entered into by the parties hereto as to its
subject matter.</p>

<h2 id="no-modifications">17. No Modifications.</h2>

<p>This Agreement may be amended only by a writing signed by MIT, ERCIM, KEIO
and the Member.</p>

<h2 id="governing-law">18. Governing Law.</h2>

<p>This Agreement shall be deemed to have been entered into and shall be
interpreted and governed in all respects by the laws of The Commonwealth of
Massachusetts and the United States of America.</p>

<h2 id="arbitration">19. Arbitration.</h2>

<p>Any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement, its
execution or breach, and any damages allegedly suffered there from, first
shall be submitted to friendly negotiation between the parties. Matters which
cannot be resolved through negotiation shall be finally settled: (i) if the
Member is organized or incorporated within any of the United States, under
the Commercial Rules of Arbitration of the American Arbitration Association,
by one (1) arbitrator appointed in accordance with said Rules, or (ii) if the
Member is organized or incorporated outside the United States, under the
