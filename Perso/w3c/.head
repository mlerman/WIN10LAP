W3C is not incorporated. It's existence is based on 
contractual relationships between various parties. The key
contract between W3C Hosts and W3C Members is the Member
Agreement:
  http://www.w3.org/2005/03/Member-Agreement

And appendix:
 http://www.w3.org/2005/03/Appendix

The appendix incorporates the W3C Process document by reference:
  http://www.w3.org/2005/10/Process-20051014/

And that document incorporates the W3C Patent Policy by reference:
 http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy-20040205/

Those are the key documents; I hope that helps.
