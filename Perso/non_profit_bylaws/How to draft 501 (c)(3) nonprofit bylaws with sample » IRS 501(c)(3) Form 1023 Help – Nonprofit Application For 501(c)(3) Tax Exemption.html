<h1>How to draft 501(c)(3) nonprofit bylaws with sample nonprofit bylaws</h1>
<hr>
							
<h2>Drafting Nonprofit Bylaws Made Easy</h2>
<p>Nonprofit bylaws are the rules and methods that your organization follows to insure legality and productivity. Nonprofit bylaws by themselves are more of an internal document than required in United States, but a well planned and clear structure will take out the guess work and corruption out of your organization especially in time of disagreement between board members. This is the document that specifies the election process of directors, your meeting manners, the role of the employees, and many more roles. Take your time when it comes to drafting your bylaws, it’s the make or break it document.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>NOTE: </strong></span>If you’d like to receive the six major documents, (<em>Articles of Incorporation, Nonprofit Bylaws, and Conflict of Interest Policy, Form 1023 Attachment, Expedite Letter Sample, and Donor Contribution Form</em>) in Microsoft Word Document format, please consider&nbsp;<a title="Please donate a few dollars to keep this site alive" href="http://form1023.org/donate">making a donation</a>&nbsp;and you’ll get to download them immedietly. This will save you weeks of copy pasting and formatting as they are ready to go templates which only need changing names and addresses.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;" align="center"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">COUNTERTERRORISM AND DUE DILIGENCE POLICY</span></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p>In furtherance of its exemption by contributions to other organizations, domestic or foreign, Transcontinental Humanitarian Corp. shall stipulate how the funds will be used and shall require the recipient to provide the corporation with detailed records and financial proof of how the funds were utilized.</p>
<p>Although adherence and compliance with the US Department of the Treasury’s publication the “Voluntary Best Practice for US. Based Charities” is not mandatory, Transcontinental Humanitarian Corp. willfully and voluntarily recognizes and puts to practice these guidelines and suggestions to reduce, develop, re-evaluate and strengthen a risk-based approach to guard against the threat of diversion of charitable funds or exploitation of charitable activity by terrorist organizations and their support networks.</p>
<p>Transcontinental Humanitarian Corp. shall also comply and put into practice the federal guidelines, suggestion, laws and limitation set forth by pre-existing U.S. legal requirements related to combating terrorist financing, which include, but are not limited to, various sanctions programs administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) in regard to its foreign activities.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;" align="center"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">DOCUMENT RETENTION POLICY</span></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>10.01 Purpose</strong></p>
<p>The purpose of this document retention policy is establishing standards for document integrity, retention, and destruction and to promote the proper treatment of Transcontinental Humanitarian Corp. records.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>10.02 Policy</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Section 1. General Guidelines</span>.<strong> </strong>Records should not be kept if they are no longer needed for the operation of the business or required by law. Unnecessary records should be eliminated from the files. The cost of maintaining records is an expense which can grow unreasonably if good housekeeping is not performed. A mass of records also makes it more difficult to find pertinent records.</p>
<p>From time to time, Transcontinental Humanitarian Corp. may establish retention or destruction policies or schedules for specific categories of records in order to ensure legal compliance, and also to accomplish other objectives, such as preserving intellectual property and cost management. Several categories of documents that warrant special consideration are identified below. While minimum retention periods are established, the retention of the documents identified below and of documents not included in the identified categories should be determined primarily by the application of the general guidelines affecting document retention, as well as the exception for litigation relevant documents and any other pertinent factors.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Section 2. Exception for Litigation Relevant Documents</span>. Transcontinental Humanitarian Corp. expects all officers, directors, and employees to comply fully with any published records retention or destruction policies and schedules, provided that all officers, directors, and employees should note the following general exception to any stated destruction schedule: If you believe, or the Transcontinental Humanitarian Corp. informs you, that corporate records are relevant to litigation, or potential litigation (i.e. a dispute that could result in litigation), then you must preserve those records until it is determined that the records are no longer needed. That exception supersedes any previously or subsequently established destruction schedule for those records.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;" align="center"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Section 3. Minimum Retention Periods for Specific Categories</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>(a)</strong> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Corporate Documents.</span> Corporate records include the corporation’s Articles of Incorporation, By-Laws and IRS Form 1023 and Application for Exemption. Corporate records should be retained permanently. IRS regulations require that the Form 1023 be available for public inspection upon request.</p>
<p><strong>(b)</strong> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Tax Records.</span> Tax records include, but may not be limited to, documents concerning payroll, expenses, proof of contributions made by donors, accounting procedures, and other documents concerning the corporation’s revenues. Tax records should be retained for at least seven years from the date of filing the applicable return.</p>
<p><strong>(c) </strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Employment Records/Personnel Records.</span> State and federal statutes require the corporation to keep certain recruitment, employment and personnel information. The corporation should also keep personnel files that reflect performance reviews and any complaints brought against the corporation or individual employees under applicable state and federal statutes. The corporation should also keep in the employee’s personnel file all final memoranda and correspondence reflecting performance reviews and actions taken by or against personnel. Employment applications should be retained for three years. Retirement and pension records should be kept permanently. Other employment and personnel records should be retained for seven years.</p>
<p><strong>(d)</strong> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Board and Board Committee Materials.</span> Meeting minutes should be retained in perpetuity in the corporation’s minute book. A clean copy of all other Board and Board Committee materials should be kept for no less than three years by the corporation.</p>
<p><strong>(e)</strong> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Press Releases/Public Filings.</span> The corporation should retain permanent copies of all press releases and publicly filed documents under the theory that the corporation should have its own copy to test the accuracy of any document a member of the public can theoretically produce against the corporation.</p>
<p><strong>(f)</strong> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Legal Files.</span> Legal counsel should be consulted to determine the retention period of particular documents, but legal documents should generally be maintained for a period of ten years.</p>
<p><strong>(g)</strong> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Marketing and Sales Documents.</span> The corporation should keep final copies of marketing and sales documents for the same period of time it keeps other corporate files, generally three years. An exception to the three-year policy may be sales invoices, contracts, leases, licenses, and other legal documentation. These documents should be kept for at least three years beyond the life of the agreement.</p>
<p><strong>(h)</strong> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Development/Intellectual Property and Trade Secrets.</span> Development documents are often subject to intellectual property protection in their final form (e.g., patents and copyrights). The documents detailing the development process are often also of value to the corporation and are protected as a trade secret where the corporation:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>(i)</strong> derives independent economic value from the secrecy of the information; and</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>(ii)</strong> has taken affirmative steps to keep the information confidential.</p>
<p>The corporation should keep all documents designated as containing trade secret information for at least the life of the trade secret.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>(i)</strong> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Contracts.</span> Final, execution copies of all contracts entered into by the corporation should be retained. The corporation should retain copies of the final contracts for at least three years beyond the life of the agreement, and longer in the case of publicly filed contracts.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>(j)</strong> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Correspondence.</span> Unless correspondence falls under another category listed elsewhere in this policy, correspondence should generally be saved for two years.</p>
<p><strong>(k)</strong> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Banking and Accounting.</span> Accounts payable ledgers and schedules should be kept for seven years. Bank reconciliations, bank statements, deposit slips and checks (unless for important payments and purchases) should be kept for three years. Any inventories of products, materials, and supplies and any invoices should be kept for seven years.</p>
<p><strong>(l)</strong> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Insurance.</span> Expired insurance policies, insurance records, accident reports, claims, etc. should be kept permanently.</p>
<p><strong>(m)</strong> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Audit Records.</span> External audit reports should be kept permanently. Internal audit reports should be kept for three years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;" align="center"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Section 4. Electronic Mail. E-mail that needs to be saved should be either:</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>(i)</strong> printed in hard copy and kept in the appropriate file; or</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>(ii)</strong> downloaded to a computer file and kept electronically or on disk as a separate file. The retention period depends upon the subject matter of the e-mail, as covered elsewhere in this policy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
