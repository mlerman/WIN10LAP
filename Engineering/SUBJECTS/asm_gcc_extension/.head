With extended asm you can read and write C variables from assembler and perform jumps from assembler code to C labels. 
Extended asm syntax uses colons (‘:’) to delimit the operand parameters after the assembler template:

asm [volatile] ( AssemblerTemplate 
                 : OutputOperands 
                 [ : InputOperands
                 [ : Clobbers ] ])
