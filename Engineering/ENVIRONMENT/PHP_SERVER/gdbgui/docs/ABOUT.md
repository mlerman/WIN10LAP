# About

[gdb (gnu debugger)](https://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/) allows you to see what is going on 'inside' another program while it executes -- or what another program was doing at the moment it crashed. It is widely distributed and used, but is terminal-based which does not always let you get a full picture of what the program is doing without looking up lots of commands.


**gdbgui** (gdb GUI, or Graphical User Interface, pronounced gee-dee-bee goo-ee) utilizes gdb to build a frontend based off of all the amazing things gdb can do.


**gdbgui** is powerful, easy to use, supplement to gdb.

It is open source and free.
