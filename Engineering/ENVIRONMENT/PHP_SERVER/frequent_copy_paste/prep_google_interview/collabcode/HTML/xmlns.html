The content of the document......

The xmlns attribute specifies the xml namespace for a document.

Note: The xmlns attribute is required in XHTML, but invalid in HTML!

However, the HTML validator at http://w3.org does not complain when the xmlns attribute is missing in an XHTML document. 
This is because the namespace "xmlns=http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" is default, and will be added to the <html> tag 
even if you do not include it.
