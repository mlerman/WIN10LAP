Most in-CSS hacks deal with selector bugs. The following is a list of browser version ranges 
and the beginnings of selectors that are known to select elements in them. 
Note that because these hacks rely on browser bugs or missing features, results may vary in some lesser-known 
or future browsers. All of these selectors use valid CSS.


IE 6 and below
    * html {}
IE 7 and below
    *:first-child+html {} * html {}

    html>body {}
Modern browsers only (not IE 7)
