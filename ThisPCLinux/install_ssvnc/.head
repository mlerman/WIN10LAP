ssvnc - a GUI wrapper for SSL and SSH VNC connections.

SYNOPSIS
       ssvnc
       ssvnc [host][:display]
       ssvnc [saved-profile-name]
       ssvnc [options] [host-or-profile]
       ssvnc -cmd [ssvnc_cmd-args]
       ssvnc -viewer [viewer-args]
       ssvnc --help

DESCRIPTION
       ssvnc  is  a tcl/tk gui wrapper that runs on Unix, MacOSX, and Windows.
       It sets up an SSL or SSH tunnel to  the  remote  VNC  Server  and  then
       launches  the  VNC  viewer (either the one provided or another one that
       you have specified) to use that encrypted tunnel to connect to the  VNC
       Server.   The  use  of  Proxies and Gateways to make the connections is
       implemented.

OPTIONS
       -help, -h   Print this help.

       --help Starts  up  the  GUI  as though the 'Help' button was pressed to
              show the main Help panel.

       -cmd [ssvnc_cmd-args]
              Launch the ssvnc_cmd utility command directly (no GUI) with  the
              given  arguments  (for use when ssvnc_cmd is not in one's PATH.)
              If neither ssvnc_cmd nor ssvncviewer is in PATH, one can  launch
              the viewer directly via: ssvnc -cmd -viewer [viewer-args] See
              the next option -viewer for an alias.

       -viewer [viewer-args]
              Shorthand for ssvnc -cmd -viewer [viewer-args].

       -profiles
              List the saved SSVNC profiles you have created.  A profile is  a
              destination host with specific parameter settings.

       -list  Same as -profiles

       -ssh   Start  in  "SSH  Only Mode".  No SSL aspects are shown.  Same as
              running the command sshvnc

       -ts    Start in "Terminal Services  Mode".   This  is  like  "SSH  Only
              Mode", but simpler and assumes x11vnc is available on the remote
              side to start and manage X and VNC sessions.   Same  as  running
              the command tsvnc

       -tso   Same as -ts "Terminal Services Mode", however never let the user
              leave this mode (no button to switch modes is  provided.)   Same
              as SSVNC_TS_ALWAYS=1.

       -ssl   Force the full GUI Mode: both SSL and SSH.  This is the default.
              Same as -ss.

       -nv    Toggle the "Verify All Certs" button to be off at startup.

       -nvb   Never show the "Verify All Certs" button.  Same as SSVNC_NO_VER-
              IFY_ALL_BUTTON=1.

       -bigger
              Make  the  Profile  Selection  Dialog  window  bigger.   Same as
              SSVNC_BIGGER_DIALOG=1.

       -noenc Start  off  in  a  mode  where a 'No Encryption' check button is
              present.   You  can  toggle  the  mode  with  Ctrl-E.   Same  as
              SSVNC_DISABLE_ENCRYPTION_BUTTON=1.  Or  noenc=1  in  ~/.ssvncrc.
              Selecting no encryption is the same as  the  vnc://  and  Vnc://
              prefixes  described  below.  The -noenc mode is now the default,
              use -enc or noenc=0 for the opposite behavior.

       -killstunnel
              On Windows, automatically terminate the STUNNEL process when the
              viewer  exits instead of prompting you (same as killstunnel=1 in
              ssvnc_rc or toggle in Options menu)

       -nokillstunnel
              On Windows, disable -killstunnel mode.  Same as killstunnel=0 in
              ssvnc_rc or toggle in Options menu.  Note that -killstunnel mode
              is now the default.

       -mycert /path/to/mycert.pem
              Set the default "MyCert" to  be  /path/to/mycert.pem.   Same  as
              -cert.  If the file does not exist, ~/.vnc/certs is prefixed and
              tried. You can also set mycert=/path/to/mycert.pem in ~/.ssvncrc

       -cacert /path/to/cacert.crt
              Set the default "ServerCert" to be /path/to/cacert.crt.  Same as
              -ca.  If the file does not exist, ~/.vnc/certs is  prefixed  and
              tried. You can also set cacert=/path/to/cacert.crt in ~/.ssvncrc

       -crl /path/to/mycrl.pem
              Set   the   default   Certificate   Revocation   List   to    be
              /path/to/mycrl.pem.  If the file does not exist, ~/.vnc/certs is
              prefixed and tried.  You can also set crl=/path/to/mycrl.pem  in
              ~/.ssvncrc.
